# LangFlow Integration 

This repository is a **LangFlow integration library** that demonstrates how to set up and use LangFlow for different real-world workflows.
It provides ready-to-use **LangFlow flows (`flow.json`)** along with instructions for running them in your own environment.

The goal of this repository is to serve as a **reference and collection of LangFlow integrations**, showing how the platform can be configured, extended, and integrated for various tasks.
